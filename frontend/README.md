# Getting Started with Chirp's React Frontend

![Chirp Bird Watching Banner](./src/Images/ChirpBanner.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How To Get Set Up

Before adjusting or making changes to any of the code, please branch out on your preferred IDE from the **main branch** to prevent any future breaking changes. Make sure to go through the following commands:

1. Branch out from the main branch.
2. Run the following command in your terminal to go into the frontend folder : **cd frontend**
3. If this a new environment and you have not downloaded any dependencies, download them using this command: **npm install --legacy-peer-deps** 
    - Do not use any **--force** commands. Essentially, this command overrides all the current dependencies and changes them which could cause breaking changes due to some packages having to configure to specific versions of other packages.
4. Run this command to start up the interface in localhost: **npm start**
5. Congratulations! You're officially set up and ready to code! :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

SIDE NOTE: TO BE IMPLEMENTED LATER ON 
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
